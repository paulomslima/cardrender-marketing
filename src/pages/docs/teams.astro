  <h1>Teams & Roles</h1>
  <p>
    Cardrender supports granular access so you can empower teams without losing control. Use roles to decide who can
    manage branding, templates, and member invites.
  </p>
  <h2>Default roles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Owner</strong>: Full access to billing, branding, and workspace settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Admin</strong>: Manage members, templates, and analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Member</strong>: Edit personal cards and signatures.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Invitations</h2>
  <p>
    Invite teammates from the Team dashboard. You can pre-create cards or let members fill in their own profiles.
  </p>
  <h2>Directory visibility</h2>
  <p>
    Control who appears in the public directory. Members can opt out when needed.
