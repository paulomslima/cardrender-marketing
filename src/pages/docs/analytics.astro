      Cardrender transforms networking from guesswork into a measurable channel. Track every view, click, and contact save to understand what resonates, optimize your outreach, and calculate ROI from conferences, campaigns, and sales conversations.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Metrics You Can Track</h2>
    <p>
      Cardrender captures engagement data automatically so you can identify high-performing cards, refine messaging, and prioritize follow-ups based on real behavior.
    </p>

    <h3>Card Views</h3>
    <p>
      Every time someone opens your card, Cardrender logs the view along with timestamp, device type, location, and referral source. Use views to measure brand awareness and identify interest spikes after events, email campaigns, or social media posts.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total views:</strong> Cumulative opens across all time</li>
      <li><strong>Unique visitors:</strong> Deduplicated count of distinct viewers</li>
      <li><strong>Repeat engagement:</strong> How many prospects return to review your card multiple times</li>
      <li><strong>View trends:</strong> Daily, weekly, and monthly performance to spot patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Link Clicks</h3>
    <p>
      Cardrender tracks clicks on every actionable element: email addresses, phone numbers, social profiles, custom CTAs, and downloads. This shows which contact methods prospects prefer and which messaging drives action.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email clicks:</strong> How many viewers clicked to compose an email</li>
      <li><strong>Phone clicks:</strong> Direct calls or messages initiated from your card</li>
      <li><strong>Social profile clicks:</strong> LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub engagement</li>
      <li><strong>Custom CTA performance:</strong> "Schedule a meeting," "View pricing," or other buttons</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contact Saves</h3>
    <p>
      The most valuable metric: how many people saved your contact details to their phone or address book. This indicates genuine interest and ensures you stay top-of-mind for future opportunities.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>vCard downloads:</strong> Number of times your contact file was saved</li>
      <li><strong>Save rate:</strong> Percentage of viewers who add you to their contacts</li>
      <li><strong>Platform breakdown:</strong> iOS vs. Android vs. desktop saves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Workspace Analytics Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      For teams, the workspace dashboard provides a <strong>unified view of performance across all members</strong>. Identify top performers, measure departmental impact, and allocate resources based on data.
    </p>

    <h3>Team Leaderboards</h3>
    <p>
      See which team members generate the most views, clicks, and contact saves. Use leaderboards to recognize high performers, identify coaching opportunities, and set benchmarks for new hires.
    </p>

    <h3>Aggregate Metrics</h3>
    <p>
      Track total team engagement across all cards:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Total views and unique visitors across the organization</li>
      <li>Most popular contact methods (email vs. phone vs. LinkedIn)</li>
      <li>Geographic distribution of your audience</li>
      <li>Device breakdown (mobile vs. desktop)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Time-Based Trends</h3>
    <p>
      Filter analytics by date range to measure performance over time. Identify seasonal patterns, evaluate campaign effectiveness, and correlate spikes with specific events or launches.
    </p>

    <h2>Event & Campaign Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Use UTM parameters or custom links to attribute engagement to specific conferences, campaigns, or outreach sequences. This helps you calculate ROI from individual marketing activities.
    </p>

    <h3>Conference Performance</h3>
    <p>
      Create a unique card URL for each event (e.g., <code>cardrender.com/john?source=ces2025</code>). After the event, compare views and saves to your baseline to measure effectiveness.
    </p>

    <h3>Email Campaign Attribution</h3>
    <p>
      Include your Cardrender link in email signatures, newsletters, or cold outreach sequences. Tag each link with a campaign identifier to measure which messaging drives the most engagement.
    </p>

    <h2>CRM & Tool Integrations</h2>
    <p>
      Cardrender integrates with popular CRMs and analytics platforms to enrich your existing workflows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Salesforce:</strong> Automatically log card views and clicks as activities on lead and contact records</li>
      <li><strong>HubSpot:</strong> Create contacts from card saves and track engagement in your marketing automation workflows</li>
      <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Send card events to GA4 for unified reporting across all digital properties</li>
      <li><strong>Slack:</strong> Receive real-time notifications when high-priority prospects view your card</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See the <a href="/docs/api">API documentation</a> for details on setting up custom integrations with webhooks and REST endpoints.
    </p>

    <h2>Exporting Data</h2>
    <p>
      Enterprise plans support data export to CSV, JSON, or direct warehouse integrations (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift). Use exported data for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building custom dashboards in Tableau, Looker, or Power BI</li>
      <li>Correlating card engagement with pipeline, revenue, and close rates</li>
      <li>Creating predictive models to identify high-intent prospects</li>
      <li>Auditing team performance for quarterly business reviews</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy & Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Cardrender collects analytics data in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 standards. We do not sell or share engagement data with third parties. You control data retention policies and can delete analytics history at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Calculating Networking ROI</h2>
    <p>
      Use analytics to quantify the value of your networking investments:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Measure baseline conversion rates:</strong> Track how many card views convert to meetings, demos, or deals</li>
      <li><strong>Attribute revenue:</strong> Use CRM integrations to link card engagement to closed-won opportunities</li>
      <li><strong>Calculate cost per acquisition:</strong> Divide total networking spend (events, travel, cards) by pipeline generated</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize based on data:</strong> Double down on high-ROI events and retire underperforming tactics</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Review analytics weekly to catch engagement spikes and follow up while interest is high</li>
      <li>A/B test different CTAs, photos, and messaging to find what resonates</li>
      <li>Set up Slack or email alerts for VIP prospects viewing your card</li>
      <li>Compare your metrics to team benchmarks to identify improvement areas</li>
      <li>Export quarterly reports to demonstrate networking ROI to leadership</li>
    </ul>
