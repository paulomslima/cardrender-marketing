  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>
    Cardrender helps you deploy digital business cards and email signatures across your team. Start by setting up a
    workspace, defining branding, and inviting your first members.
  </p>
  <h2>1. Create your workspace</h2>
  <p>
    Choose a name, upload your logo, and define primary brand colors. These settings become the foundation for all card
    templates and signatures.
  </p>
  <h2>2. Configure default templates</h2>
  <p>
    Select the card template you want new members to start with. You can enable premium templates for teams that need
    more customization.
  </p>
  <h2>3. Invite teammates</h2>
  <p>
    Add members manually or send bulk invites. Each teammate receives a pre-built card that they can personalize.
  </p>
  <h2>4. Publish and share</h2>
  <p>
    Encourage teammates to publish cards and add QR codes to their email signatures, event badges, and collateral.
