  <p>
    Digital business cards are no longer a novelty. They are now the fastest way to move from introduction to follow-up
    without losing contact details or brand consistency. Teams that once relied on paper cards are switching because the
    shift solves real operational problems.
  </p>

  <h2>Paper cards create friction you cannot measure</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional cards stop working the moment you leave the room. They get lost, stored without context, or shared with
    outdated titles. Digital cards change that with live profiles and built-in tracking.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact details stay current across every share.</li>
    <li>Teams can update titles, photos, and links in minutes.</li>
    <li>Engagement data shows which follow-ups actually matter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Branding consistency becomes automatic</h2>
  <p>
    Marketing teams spend months rolling out brand updates across email signatures and sales collateral. With digital
    cards, every profile uses shared templates, colors, and approved assets. When a brand update happens, it is a single
    change that cascades across the entire organization.
  </p>

  <h2>Analytics turns networking into a feedback loop</h2>
  <p>
    When you know which cards are viewed, clicked, or downloaded, you can improve outreach. Teams can identify which
    events drive engagement and which scripts or assets need refinement.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Digital cards are not just a replacement for paper. They are a new layer of intelligence for your team.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Why teams choose Cardrender</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Role-based access keeps your data secure.</li>
    <li>Directory and team management tools reduce admin overhead.</li>
    <li>Templates scale across sales, recruiting, and leadership.</li>
    <li>Integrations and APIs connect cards with your workflow.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>
  <p>
    If your team still relies on paper cards, start with a pilot. Launch a workspace, invite a few teammates, and see how
    easy it is to roll out a unified digital identity.
