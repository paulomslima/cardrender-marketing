CardRender offers a REST API for automating card creation, member onboarding, and analytics collection. Integrate CardRender into your existing workflows, CRM systems, and custom applications.

## Authentication

Create API keys from the workspace settings page. Keys include scoped permissions and can be revoked at any time.

All API requests must include an `Authorization` header with your API key:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Base URL

```
https://cardrender.pages.dev/api
```

## Core Endpoints

### Cards

Create, update, publish, and archive cards programmatically.

**Create a card:**
```bash
POST /cards
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userId": "user_123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "title": "Sales Director",
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "phone": "+1234567890"
}
```

**Update a card:**
```bash
PATCH /cards/:cardId
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "VP of Sales"
}
```

### Members

Invite, update roles, and deactivate members.

**Invite a member:**
```bash
POST /members/invite
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "newuser@company.com",
  "role": "member",
  "teamId": "team_456"
}
```

### Analytics

Retrieve view and click data for reporting and analysis.

**Get card analytics:**
```bash
GET /analytics/cards/:cardId?start=2025-01-01&end=2025-01-31
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "views": 156,
  "uniqueVisitors": 89,
  "clicks": {
    "email": 23,
    "phone": 12,
    "linkedin": 45
  },
  "saves": 18
}
```

## Webhooks

Use webhooks to receive real-time notifications when cards are viewed, shared, or downloaded.

### Setting Up Webhooks

Configure webhook endpoints in your workspace settings. CardRender will send POST requests to your endpoint when events occur.

**Webhook payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "card.viewed",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-30T14:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "cardId": "card_789",
    "userId": "user_123",
    "viewerId": "visitor_456",
    "location": "San Francisco, CA",
    "device": "mobile"
  }
}
```

### Available Events

- `card.viewed` - Someone opened a card
- `card.shared` - Card link was shared
- `contact.saved` - Contact was saved to device
- `link.clicked` - Any link on the card was clicked
- `member.invited` - New member was invited to workspace
- `member.activated` - Member accepted invitation

## Rate Limits

- **Standard plans:** 1,000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise plans:** 10,000 requests per hour

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 950
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1735574400
```

## Error Handling

CardRender uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `400` - Bad request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not found
- `429` - Too many requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Server error

**Error response format:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "Email address is required",
    "field": "email"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Cache API responses when appropriate to reduce requests
- Use webhooks instead of polling for real-time updates
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Store API keys securely (never commit to version control)
- Use scoped API keys with minimal required permissions
- Monitor webhook delivery failures and implement retry logic
