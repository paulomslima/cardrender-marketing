Cardrender is built to keep customer data secure while making it easy for teams to collaborate. We follow industry best practices and maintain compliance with major security standards.

## Data Encryption

### In Transit

All data transmitted to and from Cardrender is encrypted using TLS 1.3. This includes:
- API requests and responses
- Dashboard interactions
- File uploads (logos, photos, documents)
- Webhook deliveries

### At Rest

All sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption:
- User credentials (hashed with bcrypt)
- API keys and tokens
- Payment information (processed by Stripe, not stored by Cardrender)
- Personal contact information

## Access Control

### Role-Based Permissions

Cardrender enforces granular role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access specific data and features. See [Teams & Roles](/docs/teams) for details on available roles.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Workspace owners and admins can require 2FA for all members. Supported methods:
- Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
- SMS verification (available on Enterprise plans)
- Hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan)

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Enterprise customers can integrate with their identity provider:
- SAML 2.0 support for Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace
- Automatic provisioning and deprovisioning
- Enforce company authentication policies

## Audit Logging

All sensitive actions are logged for security auditing:
- Member invitations and role changes
- Card creations, updates, and deletions
- API key generation and revocation
- Export and data access events
- Login attempts and authentication failures

Workspace owners can export audit logs as CSV or stream them to SIEM tools via webhooks.

## Data Retention & Deletion

### User Control

- Users can delete their own cards at any time
- Deleted cards are soft-deleted for 30 days, then permanently removed
- Analytics data is retained for the duration of the workspace subscription
- Users can request full data export (GDPR Article 20)

### Data Residency

Cardrender uses Cloudflare's global network. Enterprise customers can request data residency in specific regions:
- United States (default)
- European Union (GDPR compliance)
- United Kingdom
- Canada

## Compliance & Certifications

### SOC 2 Type II

Cardrender maintains SOC 2 Type II certification, audited annually by independent third parties. Enterprise customers can request a copy of our SOC 2 report.
