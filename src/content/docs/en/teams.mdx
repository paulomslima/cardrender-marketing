Cardrender supports teams of all sizes with role-based permissions, bulk user management, and centralized directory controls. Scale from 10 to 10,000 users without losing control over branding, data, or access.

## Role-Based Permissions

Cardrender uses a flexible permission system that balances autonomy with governance. Assign roles based on responsibility level and operational needs.

### Available Roles

**Owner**
- Full workspace control including billing and deletion
- Manage all members, teams, and settings
- Only one owner per workspace (transferable)

**Admin**
- Manage members, teams, and workspace settings
- Configure branding, templates, and integrations
- View all analytics and export data
- Cannot access billing or delete workspace

**Manager**
- Manage specific teams and their members
- View analytics for managed teams only
- Cannot modify workspace-level settings

**Member**
- Create and edit their own cards
- View team directory
- Access basic analytics for their cards only
- Cannot manage other users

**Guest**
- View-only access to specific cards or team directory
- No editing permissions
- Useful for contractors, temporary staff, or external reviewers

## Managing Team Members

### Adding Members

Invite members individually or in bulk via CSV upload. Each invitation includes a unique link that expires after 7 days.

**Individual invite:**
1. Navigate to **Settings > Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter email address and select role
4. Add to specific teams (optional)
5. Send invitation

**Bulk invite:**
1. Download the CSV template
2. Fill in: email, role, team, custom message
3. Upload CSV file
4. Review and confirm invitations

### Deactivating Members

Deactivated members lose access immediately but their cards remain published. This preserves links shared with external contacts while preventing further edits.

To deactivate:
1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Find the member
3. Click **Actions > Deactivate**
4. Choose whether to archive their cards or reassign to another user

### Transferring Ownership

Only the current owner can transfer ownership. The new owner must accept the transfer within 48 hours.

## Team Structure

Organize members into teams that reflect your organizational hierarchy, geographic regions, or functional roles.

### Creating Teams

1. Navigate to **Settings > Teams**
2. Click **Create Team**
3. Enter team name and description
4. Assign a manager (optional)
5. Add members

### Team Settings

Each team can have:
- **Custom branding:** Override workspace branding with team-specific colors or logos
- **Template restrictions:** Limit which card templates team members can use
- **Directory visibility:** Control whether the team appears in the public directory

## Team Directory

The team directory is a public-facing page that showcases all active cards. It's perfect for:
- Company websites ("Meet Our Team" page)
- Event booths (QR code to full team roster)
- Partner portals (white-labeled directory)

### Directory Settings

**Public vs. Private:**
- Public directories are indexed by search engines
- Private directories require authentication or a secret link

**Customization:**
- Add company description and logo
- Set directory URL slug (e.g., `cardrender.com/acme-corp`)
- Choose layout: grid, list, or masonry
- Enable search and filtering by team, role, or location

## Bulk Operations

Perform actions across multiple members at once:

- **Bulk role changes:** Promote multiple members to managers
- **Team reassignment:** Move entire groups to different teams
- **Template updates:** Apply new branding to all existing cards
- **Deactivation:** Offboard departing employees in one action

## Best Practices

- Review member permissions quarterly to ensure least-privilege access
- Use teams to delegate management without granting full admin rights
- Set up onboarding automations to add new hires automatically
- Keep the directory updated by archiving cards of former employees
- Use guest roles for short-term contractors instead of full memberships
